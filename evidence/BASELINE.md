## Boundaries

- No production data, no personal data, and no live integration is in scope.
- No result in this manifest constitutes certification, conformance, or release readiness.
- Workflow presence is not merge enforcement; branch protection is not verifiable from repository content (FND-012).
- Independence is declared. Every record here is executor-produced and not independent.
